A full-stack web application that simulates a two-player Poker Dice game with betting functionality.
The project demonstrates backend–frontend integration using Spring Boot and JavaScript, including RESTful communication and game logic implementation.
---
## 📌 Project Overview
This application allows two players to roll dice, reroll selected dice (up to three total rolls), and automatically evaluates poker-style combinations.
A betting system is implemented, allowing the user to place a bet on a specific player and combination before the round starts.
The backend processes all combination logic, while the frontend dynamically updates the UI using Fetch API.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Backend**
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- REST Controller
- Service Layer
- DTO Pattern
**Frontend**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Fetch API
**Architecture Style**
- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → DTO)
- Separation of concerns
- REST-based communication
---
## 🏗 Architecture
Frontend (JSP + JS)
↓
REST API (/api/roll, /api/roll/custom)
↓
Controller (handles HTTP requests)
↓
Service (business logic & combination evaluation)
↓
DTO (JSON response returned to frontend

## 🎮 Game Logic
### Backend Responsibilities
- Generate random dice values
- Count dice occurrences using HashMap
- Determine combinations:
- Five of a kind
- Four of a kind
- Full House
- Three of a kind
- Two Pair
- One Pair
- Nothing
- Return structured JSON response
### Frontend Responsibilities
- Render dice dynamically
- Handle reroll selection using JavaScript Sets
- Communicate with backend via Fetch API
- Update UI state and coin balance
- Determine round winner based on combination ranking
